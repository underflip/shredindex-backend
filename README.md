## Setup

A set of Docker platform is included for running the project.

### Preparation

1. Install Docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. If not installed with Docker Desktop, Docker Compose install https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
3. Copy `.infrastructre/docker-compose.yml.dist` to `.infrastructre/docker-compose.yml`
4. Copy `.infrastructre/.env.dist` to `.infrastructre/.env`
5. Copy `.infrastructre/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.dist` to `.infrastructre/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
6. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`

Optionally, you can make any changes to the resulting `.env` `docker-compose.yml` and `default.conf` to suit your needs.

### Up

From `.infrastructure/` use

```
docker-compose up -d
```

When all docker containers are running, use

```
docker exec shredindex-backend-php php artisan october:up
```

Copy the Admin password generated by `php artisan october:up`, supplied during the terminal output. E.g:

```
...
- The following password has been automatically generated for the "admin" account: sVHffUkY7BR5F5AngwDCV1
```

(Note: A new password is generated every time)

### Open in browser

If you are using the default preparation: Visit [http://localhost:8080/backend](http://localhost:8080/backend)

### GraphQL

You can query the GraphQL server at `/graphql` e.g `http://localhost:8080/graphql`

An easy way to query the GraphQL server is to use the [Chrome GraphiQL extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphiql-extension/jhbedfdjpmemmbghfecnaeeiokonjclb)
